<h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

<h3>
What is HTML?</h3>

<p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language buildsites. HTML is what 
I would consider a rough draft of a website. It doesn't have any style or animations, just the words on the page.
So with HTML I could create headings, using the h1-h6 tags, paragraphs using the p tag, and buttons that bring you to different
things. All the tags are encased in the < and closed with the >. HTML was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, and later created the first website in 1995.

<h3>What is CSS?</h3>

    CSS, or cascading style sheets, is the computer language used to style a website. With CSS you can do a lot more things than you can in HTML. You can change the font, add pictures and adjust them, add animations, backgrounds, and way more. It was created in 1994 by Hakon Wium,
    who was working with Tim Berners-Lee on HTML at the time. CSS is written not using the tags used in HTML, but instead tags such as < style>, or < body>, and inside just plain h1, or h5, or p, or whatever your using. After that, you put the { } 's, and inside you put your properties.

<h3>What are tags?</h3>
<img id="tags" src="http://pixel.brit.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HTML-and-CSS-Book.jpg" alt="tags" width="150">
<p>A tag is a statement wrapped inside of the < and closed with a </>. These statements 
can be many things, such as a heading, to create a heading you would do < h1-h6 > (without spaces) and then close with </ h1-h6>. 
In Between the two you would write the heading. You could also do paragraphs, with < p>, then your paragraph, then closed with < /p>.
Also you can do  Some tags don't need to be closed, such as the < br> tag, which allows a paragraph to indent. You can also have tags
where you have more tags inside, like the < body> tag, where you can put in things that apply to the whole page. Also the < style> tag,
where you can add styles to a certain parts of the page. You always have to have something inside the tags though or its just nothing.  </p>
