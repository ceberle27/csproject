    Computer Hardware

<h2>Motherboard</h2>
<img id="motherboard" src="http://images.anandtech.com/doci/7548/ASUS%20CVFZ.jpg" alt="motherboard" width="150">
<p>A motherboard, is the main circut board found in a computer or other expandable systems. The 
motherboard is in a way the main part of a computer. It connects all the parts and gives them the ability
to communicate to eachother to make the whole computer work. The RAM, moniter, CPU, memory, keyboard and mouse, 
are all just some excamples of things that connect to the motherboard. They all rely on the motherboard to make everything 
work. I like to think of the motherboard as the body of a computer, or the heart of it.</p>
   
   <h2>CPU</h2>
   
   <img id="CPU" src="https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/com-basics/files/2014/05/Intel-CPU.jpg" alt="CPU" width="150">
   
   
   <p>The CPU, which I think of as the brains of a computer, is sort of like functions in math. It takes an input of a computer
   program and creates an output. It stands for centralized procesing unit.</p>
    
    <h2>RAM</h2>
 
    <img id="RAM" src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/444492/file-2483232956-jpg/Blog/2011/RAM.jpg" alt="RAM" width="150">
    
    <p> RAM, or random acces memory, is a type of computer data storage. A RAM device allows data items to be accessed in just about the same amount of time regardless of the accual location of data inside the memory.</p>
    
    <h2>Hard drive </h2>
   
    <img id="HDD" src="http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Seagate-HDD.jpg" alt="HDD" width="150">
    
    <p>The hard drive disk, or HDD, is a data storage device. It stores data that it can access later. The hard drive is a disk that is spinning constantly while the computer is on. So pretty much all of your downloads, games, apps, they take up data, and that data is stored on the hard drive disk.</p>
    
    <h2>How are they all connected?</h2>
   
    <img id="HOW" src="http://build-your-own-computer.org/images/intel-dx58-top.jpg" alt="HOW" width="150">
    
    <p>All of the parts to a computer are connected through the motherboard The motherboard, since it is the main part to the computer, has all the other parts connected to it.
    The CPU, RAM, HDD, moniter, everything.</p>
  
    <h2>Mouse, Moniter, keyboard</h2>
   
    <img id="MMK" src="http://www.build-your-own-computer.net/image-files/computer-mice-08.jpg" alt="MMK" width="150">
    <img id"moniter" src="http://www.lankabiznet.com/103-large/samsung-216-led-moniter.jpg" alt="moniter" width="150">
    <img id"key" src="http://img.wonderhowto.com/img/00/36/63487814715361/0/use-most-important-keyboard-shortcuts-windows-8.1280x600.jpg" alt="key" width="150">
    
    <p>The mouse is a device that detects how your moving it, and sends that signal to the computer which picks it up and makes the curser on your screen move. The moniter, is pretty much just your screen. The accual computer is under your keyboard, all around the motherboard, and the motherboard of course. The computer sends all of the content 
    up to the moniter, which receives it and puts up everything you see on the screen. The keyboard is what you use to type in anything. It  has a display of letters, and you press them and the letters pop up on the screen.</p>
