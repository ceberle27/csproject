            Hi, my name is Cameron, and I am a freshman at Everest public high school. 
            Some hobbies include guitar, coding, video games and TV. My favorite TV show that I
            am watching right now is called Psych, a show about a hyper observant person who says he is a psychic and works for the police. But in general my favorite show is Doctor Who, 
            which is a show about an alien with a time machine who goes around the universe with a partner saving people and planets and even galaxies. I started playing guitar a couple months ago and
            take lessons at the music store in downtown san carlos. I have learned mostly theme songs so far, including Star Wars, Mission Impossible, James Bond, and Batman, and have now moved on to chords.
            I have a lot of different video games but don't play most of them anymore. I used to be addicted to video games through middle, and elementary school, but then lost the time to be playing them all the time 
            in high school. I still do play some games on my phone, such as happy wheels, an obstacle course game, which I also play on the computer. So far I don't have a lot of experience on coding, but in expeditions I took a computer science course. 
            I am also helping code a game in javascript I have been many places in my life, and recently I went on a trip where I went all over Europe. My dad was on a business trip which was in Europe and he decided to bring me with him for my birthday and graduation.
            We first landed in new york and spent an hour there, then hopped back on the plane and went to Germany. We spent three days there, since my dad had his business stuff he had to do for part of the time. while he was doing that I just sat in the business building 6 stories up watching youtube. 
            After that we drove to France and spent a day there walking around. We then drove through the Swiss Alps into Italy, and again spent a day there walking around. We then went to the Czech Republic for a day, and then back to Germany where we toured two castles, one of which was Walt Disney's inspiration for creating all the disney castles. While we were there it was also raining very heavily. We then flew back to America.
